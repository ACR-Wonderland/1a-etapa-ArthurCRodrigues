# Feedback para ArthurCRodrigues:

Nota final: **18.5/100**

Thank you for your submission. Here’s some feedback on your code and overall structure:

### General Feedback
1. **Error Handling**: You have some basic error handling in place, but it could be improved. For instance, in the `/sugestao` and `/contato` routes, you're replacing placeholders with empty strings. This can lead to issues if the placeholders are not present in the HTML files. Consider using more descriptive placeholders (e.g., `{{name}}`, `{{ingredients}}`) and ensure you handle cases where the query parameters might be missing.

2. **Use of `req.query` for POST Requests**: In the `/contato` POST route, you are using `req.query` to retrieve data. This is incorrect as POST data should be accessed through `req.body`. You will need to use middleware like `express.urlencoded()` or `express.json()` to parse the incoming request body.

3. **Static File Serving**: You are serving static files from the `public` directory, which is good. However, make sure the directory structure matches your code expectations, and verify that all referenced files exist.

4. **404 Error Handling**: Your middleware for handling 404 errors is correctly placed at the end. However, consider logging the request URL or method for better debugging.

5. **Test Results**: You mentioned that several tests failed. It would be helpful to provide details on what tests failed and any error messages received. This will help pinpoint specific issues in your code.

### Specific Code Feedback
- **Placeholder Replacement**: In both the `/sugestao` and `/contato` routes, the `replace` function is called with an empty string as the first argument. This will not work as intended. You need to specify what you want to replace (e.g., `data.replace('{{placeholder}}', ...)`).

- **Dependencies**: Ensure that all dependencies in `package.json` are necessary for your application. For instance, if you are not using Angular in your application, consider removing it from the dependencies.

- **File Not Found Error**: You mentioned a file not found error for `routes/api.js`. If this file is intended to be part of your project, ensure it exists in the correct directory. If it's not necessary, you can remove any references to it.

### Suggested Improvements
- **Unit Tests**: Implement unit tests for your routes using a testing framework like Mocha or Jest. This will help you catch errors early and ensure your application behaves as expected.

- **Environment Variables**: Consider using environment variables for configuration, such as the port number. This makes your application more flexible and easier to deploy in different environments.

- **Documentation**: Enhance your documentation in `package.json` by providing a description of your project and adding any relevant instructions for running the application.

### Conclusion
Overall, your application has a solid foundation, but there are several areas for improvement, particularly regarding error handling and the handling of request data. Addressing these issues will help ensure your application is robust and functional. If you can provide more details on the test failures, I would be happy to help troubleshoot those specific issues as well.
